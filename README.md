In this article, we are going to create a scissor paper game using the function of the Python programming language. Our game will be based on the rules of Rock Paper Scissors. We see one request from the user and then from the computer which randomly selects from Rock, Paper and Scissors. Then we compare the user input with the selection and then through conditional comparison, I determine who wins.
